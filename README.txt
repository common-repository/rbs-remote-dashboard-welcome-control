Create a custom Remote Dashboard Welcome page for your users on your own website.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a (standard WordPress) page on your installation. The main purpose is to be able to show all your clients the same dashboard welcome, while you\'re still able to update the contents of the page on your own website.
While it works without it, it is designed to work in conjunction with the module RBS Remote Dashboard Welcome (https://roadbearstudios.com/plugins/rbs-remote-dashboard-welcome). 

== Installation ==
Upload the package contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.

Or login to WordPress. Go to Plugins -> Add New and upload the zip-file of the plugin. Then activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.
